# Tab-Manager

I open tabs all over the place from Figma to how to grow arugula so my browser gets cluttered fast. This extension helps you sort tabs alphabetically by domain for now and close search tabs from Yandex and Google to keep things tidy.

## What it does

• Sorts your tabs alphabetically by domain  
• Closes search result tabs from Yandex and Google

## How to install

1. Download and unzip the extension folder  
2. Go to your browser’s extensions page  
   For Yandex Browser use `browser://extensions`  
   For Chrome use `chrome://extensions`  
3. Turn on Developer Mode (usually a toggle in the top right)  
4. Click "Load unpacked" and pick the extension folder  
5. The extension should be ready to use

> [!WARNING]
> The extension only works with Developer Mode on. If it’s off it won’t load.

## Why Developer Mode

Since this is not published in the official stores yet browsers need Developer Mode enabled to load itё

## What’s next

• More sorting and filtering options
• Better UI and user experience

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you wanna help out or have ideas.

Hope it helps keep your tabs under control and saves you some time.
