# Tab-Manager

I open tabs very randomly and a lot, from figma to how to plant arugula, so tabs often accumulate in my browser. I made an extension that can sort them alphabetically by domain (for now), as well as close search tabs (Yandex and Chrome).

So far, to install it, you need to download the zip, go to your browser, go to the browser://extensions for Yandex or chrome://extensions for Chrome tab, turn on developer mode and Download the unpacked extension, then select the folder with it, that's it, it's ready to work.

Please note that it will not work with developer mode turned off.
